------------JAR file-------------
A JAR (Java Archive) file is a package file format used in
 the Java ecosystem to bundle multiple files into a single
  archive. It is primarily used to distribute Java classes,
   associated metadata, and resources like images or configuration
    files. A JAR file is essentially a compressed ZIP file with
    a .jar extension and follows the ZIP file structure.
    JAR	Bundles Java classes and resources	Libraries, applications
    WAR	Web Application Archive (extends JAR)	Web apps for servlet containers (e.g., Tomcat)
    EAR	Enterprise Archive (bundles WAR/JAR files)	Enterprise Java applications (e.g., JBos


----------------Maven--------------
when we generate projects using spring initializr - start.spring.io
can generate a maven project for u
dependencies in pom.xml, like package.json in npm
Maven is a project management tool
most popular use of maven is for build management and dependencies
kindoff like npm, but here its used as a build tool as well

Problems solved by maven -
- when building java project, may need additional JAR files.
- example - Spring, Hibernate, Commons Logging, JSON etc

- manually it can also be done, by individually downloading those JAR files from each project web site and add
the JAR files to build path/classpath
